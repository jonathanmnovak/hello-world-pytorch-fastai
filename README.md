# hello-world-pytorch-fastai
This repo is used to explore and learn Pytorch and fastai by following the
book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and Pytorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)
along with the corresponding [repo](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) and 
[online course](https://course.fast.ai/).

# Setup
The environment for this project was setup using
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and the `pyproject.toml` is included to 
reproduce the environment.

# Chapters
Each chapter will have a corresponding Jupyter notebook. The book
and course recommend running these notebooks in Kaggle but
I'll be recreating and/or developing new notebooks which 
cover the material in the chapter on my local machine.
